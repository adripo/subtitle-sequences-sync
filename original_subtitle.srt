00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,753
No, can't be.

393
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:03,294
You're on my class list.

394
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:03,294
Okay, so--

395
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:06,254
No, I'm supposed to be

396
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:06,254
in Miss Cole's class.

397
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,004
My dad called weeks ago.

398
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,754
I'm certain

399
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,754
the list is wrong.

400
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,796
The names are generated

401
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,796
through a computer

402
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,504
and chosen randomly,

403
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,504
Alice.

404
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,587
Perhaps your father

405
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,587
misunderstood.

406
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,088
No, I'm really supposed

407
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,088
to be in Miss Cole's room.

408
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,922
That's what he told me.

409
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,046
Perhaps you'd like

410
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,046
to take it up

411
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:30,088
with Mr. Edgecombe,

412
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:30,088
the principal.

413
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:33,463
Yes.

414
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:34,713
Come on up here.

415
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:35,713
Get your hall pass.

416
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:35,713
Come on.

417
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:39,089
He's right down the hall.

418
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,256
Go, quick.

419
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,256
Go, go.

420
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,881
His office

421
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,881
is right down

422
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,881
the hall that way.

423
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,590
What can I do

424
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,590
for you?

425
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,090
I know names

426
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,090
are chosen randomly,

427
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,840
but my dad said he

428
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,840
really wanted me

429
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:09,340
to be in Miss Cole's class,

430
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,632
'cause he said that

431
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,632
she's cool and confident,

432
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:14,008
and he said that she's

433
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:14,008
the most amazing person ever,

434
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,967
so he really wanted me

435
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,967
to be in her class.

436
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,174
Your dad said that, right?

437
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,925
Okay, when was this?

438
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:25,299
Last week, um...

439
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,841
because we just moved here.

440
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,383
Well, if you are

441
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,383
new to our school,

442
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:30,633
you wouldn't know

443
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:30,633
very much

444
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,842
about any of our teachers,

445
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,842
now, would you?

446
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,676
We found it's best

447
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:36,634
not to play

448
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:36,634
musical chairs

449
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,884
with our classrooms.

450
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,801
And I like to believe

451
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,801
that all 3

452
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:42,217
of our 6th grade teachers

453
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:42,217
are excellent, Alice.

454
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,092
Now...

455
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,425
I'm sure that if you

456
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,425
put forth the effort,

457
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,801
you'll find that

458
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,801
you and Mrs. Plotkin

459
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,176
will get along just fine.

460
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:51,760
All right?

461
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:06,094
[Miss Cole]

462
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:06,094
Okay. Joke of the day.

463
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,344
What did baby corn say

464
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,344
to mommy corn?

465
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:11,052
I don't know. What?

466
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:11,052
"Where's popcorn?"

467
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:13,177
[all laughing]

468
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:14,844
I know what

469
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:14,844
I just did was wrong,

470
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:16,177
and I should never lie,

471
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:19,177
but when I look

472
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:19,177
at Miss Cole,

473
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,094
I can't help myself.

474
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,428
That's awesome.

475
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,428
Okay, Hailey,

476
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,428
your turn.

477
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,345
So, how was

478
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,345
the first day?

479
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,053
Killer.

480
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,053
Guys are cool,

481
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,053
girls are hot,

482
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,679
and I'm already

483
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,679
talking about

484
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,679
starting a band.

485
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,262
Right on.

486
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,262
How about you, Alice?

487
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,262
Well, I got elected

488
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,262
class president

489
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,720
after being there

490
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,720
for 5 minutes.

491
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:41,805
Wow.

492
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:41,805
Congratulations.

493
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:43,263
I'm kidding, Dad.

494
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:45,638
I have no friends,

495
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,554
and I got the worst teacher

496
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,554
in the whole school.

497
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:48,721
I just want to go home.

498
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,638
I thought you

499
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,638
wanted pizza.

500
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,972
No, our real home.

501
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,888
Okay.

502
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,888
This is our home now.

503
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,805
I explained to you guys

504
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,014
how important it is for me

505
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,097
to own that

506
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,097
music store, okay?

507
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,264
It was the first day.

508
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,264
I'm sure it'll get better.

509
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,681
I don't know anyone.

510
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,681
I feel like a freak.

511
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,097
Making friends

512
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,097
is the hard part,

513
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:10,305
but I'm sure that

514
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:10,305
you will, and soon.

515
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:13,347
I'm not like Lester.

516
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:13,347
He already has a band

517
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,347
and a bunch

518
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,347
of groupies.

519
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,765
Yeah, but when

520
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,765
he was your age,

521
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,890
he was very shy.

522
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,890
Mom and I, we decided

523
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,890
he was so immature,

524
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,932
we'd keep him

525
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,932
back a year.

526
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,556
You said I got

527
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,556
the chicken pox

528
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:26,056
and fell behind

529
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:26,056
in school.

530
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,640
Well, now you're old enough

531
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,640
to know the truth.

532
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,390
Thanks, Dad.

533
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,390
You just made my day.

534
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,848
That's funny.

535
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,516
Feel better now?

536
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,182
A little.

537
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,182
But Mrs. Plotkin

538
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,182
still stinks.

539
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,933
Oh, look.

540
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,933
Hey, Pamela,

541
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,933
this is Alice.

542
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,892
Oh, are you

543
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,892
the peeping tom?

544
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,183
What?

545
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:57,058
Patrick is telling

546
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:57,058
all the guys at school

547
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:57,058
to watch out for you.

548
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,517
He said you tried

549
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,517
to see him naked.

550
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,141
No, that was just

551
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,141
a mistake, that's all.

552
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,976
Come on, details.

553
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,976
How much did you see?

554
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,268
I didn't see anything.

555
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,601
Okay, I maybe saw

556
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,601
his underwear.

557
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,977
[chuckles]

558
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,977
Boxers or briefs?

559
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,977
I'm not saying.

560
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:14,935
Come on.

561
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,268
Boxers.

562
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,601
[chuckles]

563
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:20,184
That's great.

564
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:20,184
Wait until I tell everyone.

565
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,893
Hey, listen to what

566
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,893
the new girl

567
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,559
has to say about

568
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,559
Patrick's underwear.

569
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,894
No, I didn't mean

570
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,894
for you--

571
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,894
[gasps]

572
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,978
[laughing, chattering]

573
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,519
[Girl]

574
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,519
Oh, my gosh!

575
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,602
Yeah.

576
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,519
Things are really

577
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,519
looking up.

578
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,020
[Mrs. Plotkin]

579
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,020
I always like

580
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,020
to end the day by

581
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,395
reading a book

582
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,395
to my class.

583
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:56,812
Every year we start

584
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:56,812
with my favorite novel,

585
00:17:56,853 --> 00:17:58,812
<i>The Adventures</i>

586
00:17:56,853 --> 00:17:58,812
<i>of Tom Sawyer </i>

587
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:01,896

00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,039
was a complete accident.

784
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:32,331
That's...why not.

785
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:34,748
Well, then, who told

802
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:56,1000

808
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:05,749

810

00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:43,160
What are you doing?

1551
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:45,869
Oh, I was just, uh,

1552
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:45,869
playing a song.

1553
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:49,787
Sounds kind of

1554
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:49,787
girly to me.

1555
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:49,787
[woman chuckles]

1556
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:52,495
I think it sounds great.

1557
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:55,161
Alice, you remember Kelly?

1558
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,120
Sure.

1559
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:59,536
Hi, Alice.

1560
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:01,912
Um, I'm gonna

1561
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:01,912
head upstairs.

1562
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:03,912
I have a lot of homework.

1563
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:07,204
Terrific.

1564
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:07,204
I'll be up soon.

1565
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:10,080
[Kelly]

1566
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:10,080
Bye, Alice.

1567
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:10,080
Bye.

1568
00:47:14,412 --> 00:47:17,245
Everything all right

1569
00:47:14,412 --> 00:47:17,245
with her?

1570
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:21,913
We had a fight

1571
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:21,913
last night, and, um,

1572
00:47:21,954 --> 00:47:25,497
I just never

1573
00:47:21,954 --> 00:47:25,497
know if I'm doing

1574
00:47:21,954 --> 00:47:25,497
the right thing or not.

1575
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:28,747
There is no "right thing"

1576
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:28,747
with an 11-year-old girl.

1577
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:39,998
Oh, Alice,

1578
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:39,998
I wanted to

1579
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:39,998
speak to you.

1580
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,414
Since you've finished

1581
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,414
all your work,

1582
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:44,123
I figured you could

1583
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:44,123
skip detention today

1584
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:45,831
and go to play

1585
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:45,831
rehearsal, okay?

1586
00:47:45,873 --> 00:47:48,456
Thanks, Mrs. Plotkin,

1587
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,664
but I'm only Frog #3.

1588
00:47:50,706 --> 00:47:52,623
Oh, I know

1589
00:47:50,706 --> 00:47:52,623
Miss Cole feels

1590
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,456
every part is

1591
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,456
very important.

1592
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,664
And I thought you

1593
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,664
were looking forward

1594
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:58,165
to performing in front

1595
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:58,165
of the whole school.

1596
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:03,248
I didn't really care

1597
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:03,248
about the part.

1598
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:03,248
I just...

1599
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,457
I wanted to be with...

1600
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,457
Miss Cole?

1601
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:12,083
Well, if so, why,

1602
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:12,083
you could do that.

1603
00:48:12,124 --> 00:48:14,124
Really?

1604
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:15,291
Well, I'm sure she's

1605
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:15,291
bogged down

1606
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,917
with a lot of work

1607
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,917
doing this musical.

1608
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:19,125
Maybe you could help her

1609
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:19,125
after school like you did

1610
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:19,125
for me.

1611
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,291
You think so?

1612
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,291
It's worth a shot.

1613
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,625
Why don't you ask her?

1614
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,625
She's over there.

1615
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,166
Thanks.

1616
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,166
I think I'll do that.

1617
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:34,459
Hi, Miss Cole.

1618
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:36,209
Oh, hi, Alice.

1619
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:36,209
Hi.

1620
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,417
I was wondering

1621
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,417
if I could maybe

1622
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,417
help you decorate,

1623
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,542
or if you need any

1624
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,542
help with anything.

1625
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,626
Sure, sure.

1626
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,626
Yeah, I could

1627
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,626
use some help.

1628
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:43,667
Okay.

1629
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:45,167
[chattering]

1630
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:01,627
Hey.

1631
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:01,627
Hey.

1632
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:09,087
You and Dad okay?

1633
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:09,087
I guess.

1634
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:11,669
I think you

1635
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:11,669
should give him a chance.

1636
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:13,378
He's trying the best he can.

1637
00:49:13,419 --> 00:49:16,461
What's up with him

1638
00:49:13,419 --> 00:49:16,461
and that Kelly lady?

1639
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,795
I don't know.

1640
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,795
I think he likes her.

1641
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:23,128
Well, he wouldn't

1642
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:23,128
get married, would he?

1643
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,462
Who knows?

1644
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,962
But you'd better get

1645
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,962
used to the idea, Al,

1646
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,962
'cause it could happen.

1647
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:31,879
If Dad was gonna

1648
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:31,879
marry someone,

1649
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:34,921
they'd have to be

1650
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:34,921
really, really special.

1651
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:40,962
Thanks.

1652
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,463
Hey, Marilyn.

1653
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,463
Sorry I forgot

1654
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,463
to tell you

1655
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:51,755
I'd be working today,

1656
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:51,755
but maybe we can get

1657
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:51,755
together later.

1658
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:55,380
That's okay.

1659
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:55,380
I'm here to see Lester.

1660
00:49:58,047 --> 00:49:59,881
Hey, Lester.

1661
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:04,381
Hey, Marilyn.

1662
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:04,381
What are you doing here?

1663
00:50:04,422 --> 00:50:06,297
I was just finishing some

1664
00:50:04,422 --> 00:50:06,297
shopping down the street,

1665
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:08,255
and I thought I'd stop by

1666
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:08,255
to see if maybe you wanted

1667
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,881
to walk home together.

1668
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,589
[whispering]

1669
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,589
I'm really busy

1670
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,589
right now.

1671
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:17,924
Um, can I call you back,

1672
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:17,924
like, later?

1673
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:19,757
Why are you whispering?

1674
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:22,965
Oh, I don't want

1675
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:22,965
to bother the customers.

1676
00:50:23,007 --> 00:50:25,091
Um, I got to go

1677
00:50:23,007 --> 00:50:25,091
downstairs, but...

1678
00:50:25,132 --> 00:50:28,007
Lester,

1679
00:50:25,132 --> 00:50:28,007
why is Marilyn here?

1680
00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:29,298
Uh-oh.

1681
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,382
I-I don't know.

1682
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:32,924
Are you seeing her?

1683
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:37,133
Kind of.

1684
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:38,591
What's that supposed

1685
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:38,591
to mean?

1686
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:41,216
Yeah, what is that

1687
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:41,216
supposed to mean?

1688
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:43,841
I didn't even know

1689
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:43,841
you guys were friends.

1690
00:50:43,883 --> 00:50:45,800
Well, we are.

1691
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,758
Yeah, we are.

1692
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,424
And we're also friends

1693
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,424
with just about every

1694
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,424
girl in school.

1695
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,801
Who are all going

1696
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,801
to know

1697
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,175
what a slime ball

1698
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,258
you are.

1699
00:50:58,425 --> 00:50:59,550
Is there something

1700
00:50:58,425 --> 00:50:59,550
I can do?

1701
00:50:59,592 --> 00:51:01,217
How about dropping dead?

1702
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,634
You want to go to

1703
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,634
the movies tonight?

1704
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:04,634
Sure.

1705
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,425
I get off at 6.

1706
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,425
I'll come by.

1707
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,425
Great.

1708
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:17,301
Guess there's a downside

1709
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:17,301
to making friends easily.

1710
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:27,928
Okay.

1711
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:29,095
I'm done, Miss Cole.

1712
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:32,011
That's excellent work, Alice.

1713
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:33,677
I just wish I could

1714
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:33,677
take you home

1715
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,095
and have you straighten up

1716
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,095
my apartment.

1717
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:36,095
Oh, I'd be happy to.

1718
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,803
I'm only kidding.

1719
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:41,844
Well, not about me

1720
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:41,844
being a slob.

1721
00:51:41,886 --> 00:51:43,344
I'm a total mess.

1722
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:45,929
Why? You always

1723
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:45,929
look so neat.

1724
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,470
Mmm, it's all

1725
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,470
an illusion.

1726
00:51:48,512 --> 00:51:50,678
You know us girls.

1727
00:51:48,512 --> 00:51:50,678
We have our ways, right?

1728
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,512
Right.

1729
00:51:52,553 --> 00:51:54,762
You know, Alice,

1730
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:57,678
I was just considering

1731
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:57,678
changing a part of the play,

1732
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,804
and I think you might be

1733
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,804
perfect for the part I need.

1734
00:51:59,845 --> 00:52:01,638
Really?

1735
00:51:59,845 --> 00:52:01,638
Yeah.

1736
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,471
You'll still be a frog,

1737
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,471
but I was considering

1738
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:06,429
giving one of the frogs

1739
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:06,429
a larger role.

1740
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:09,138

or woman, in this case.

1743
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,179
It won't be much of a change

1744
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,179
from what you're doing now,

1745
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:15,805
but you'll have a great moment

1746
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:15,805
in the first act.

1747
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:17,971
A small dance number.

1748
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:17,971
Would you be up for it?

1749
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,472
Definitely.

1750
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,472
Great.

1751
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:23,305
Well, then, I'll see you

1752
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:23,305
at rehearsal later

1753
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:23,305
in the week.

1754
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:24,389
I'm really looking

1755
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:24,389
forward to this.

1756
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,389

1758
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,514
See you then.

1759
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:31,764
Okay, it may not be

1760
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:31,764
the Princess role,

1761
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:31,764
but it's almost as good.

1762
00:52:31,806 --> 00:52:34,222
My own dance solo?

1763
00:52:34,263 --> 00:52:35,555
Just 'cause I can't sing

1764
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:38,057
doesn't mean I can't be

1765
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:38,057
a star.

1766
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,264

Jump, jump.

1771
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:50,765
Okay, you try it.

1772
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:50,765
Okay.

1773

[bell rings]

1774
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:01,891
Jump, jump.

1775
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,349
That's great.

1776
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,349
You're really taking

1777
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,349
to this dance.

1778
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,849
Well, it's a fun part.

1779
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,432
Well, you're

1780
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,432
perfect for it.

1781
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:10,141
Um, I could help you

1782
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:10,141
carry all this

1783
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:12,017
back to your room

1784
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:12,017
and put it away.

1785
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,558
Ah, that would be

1786
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,558
great, Alice.

1787
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,809
Thanks so much

1788
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,809
for offering.

1789
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,642
Miss Cole?

1790
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,809
I'll bet you like

1791
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,809
musicals, don't you?

1792
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,266
Of course I do.

1793
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:25,350
That's why I like trying

1794
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:25,350
to find new and unusual ones

1795
00:53:25,392 --> 00:53:27,017
for you kids to perform.

1796
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,725
Well, did you know

1797
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,725
my dad owns a music

1798
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:28,725

1799
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:30,601
Oh.

1800
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,851
And he carries

1801
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,851
all types of sheet music

1802
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,851
for all types of musicals.

1803
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:35,060
Oh, I'll have

1804
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:35,060
to stop by sometime.

1805
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:36,810
Great. Well, here's

1806
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:36,810
the address,

1807
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:38,768
and I usually help

1808
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:38,768
him on Saturdays.

1809
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,643
Maybe I'll stop by

1810
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,643
this weekend.

1811
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:44,684
Sometimes I'm so brilliant

1812
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:44,684
it's scary.

1813
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:50,602
I can help too,

1814
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:50,602
Miss Cole.

1815
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,685
Wow, I have my choice

1816
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,685
of helpers today.

1817
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:53,394
Thank you, Pamela.

1818
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:57,185
You don't have

1819
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:57,185
to stay, Pamela.

1820
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,519
I'm sure you're

1821
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,519
really busy with all

1822
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,519
the extra rehearsals.

1823
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,727
Oh, it's not a problem.

1824
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,727
I like helping Miss Cole.

1825
00:54:15,603 --> 00:54:19,686
Thanks so much

1826
00:54:15,603 --> 00:54:19,686
for your help, girls.

1827
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,604
I could help wash

1828
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,604
the boards, if you want.

1829
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:25,729
Hmm. Well, I suppose they

1830
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:25,729
could use a washing.

1831
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:27,105
I'll take you up

1832
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:27,105
on your offer, Alice.

1833
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:32,021
The supply shelves are

1834
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:32,021
looking a little messy.

1835
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:32,854
I could straighten them out.

1836
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:36,229
Well, if you really

1837
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:36,229
want to, Pamela,

1838
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,896
but it's not necessary.

1839
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:39,897
You've already done

1840
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:39,897
enough already.

1841
00:54:39,939 --> 00:54:42,730
It's okay.

1842
00:54:39,939 --> 00:54:42,730
I'd love to help.

1844
00:54:47,605 --> 00:54:50,563
I'm so glad Pamela

1845
00:54:47,605 --> 00:54:50,563
offered to help

1846
00:54:47,605 --> 00:54:50,563
this afternoon.

1847
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:51,980
Now I have time

00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,939
to go shopping

1849

1850
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,898

you could go home

about an hour ago.

1931
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,115
Miss Cole is interested

1932
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,115
in everybody.

1933
00:57:22,156 --> 00:57:24,280
She's very social.

1934
00:57:22,156 --> 00:57:24,280
Right, Miss Cole?

1935
00:57:24,322 --> 00:57:26,197
I guess.

1936
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,948
So, was there anything

1937
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,948
in particular

1938
00:57:28,989 --> 00:57:31,156
that you were looking for?

1939
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,615
No, I just thought

1940
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,615
I'd browse through

1941
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,615
your sheet music.

1942
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,074
Great. If you

1943
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,074
need anything,

1944
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,074
just let me know.

1945
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:39,074
In the meantime,

1946
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:39,074
I'd like a word

1947
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:39,074
with Alice.

1948
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:43,074
Of course.

1949
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:43,074
I should be getting

1950
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:43,074
home soon anyway.

1951
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,199
I know you mean well, Alice,

1952
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,199
and you're trying to help,

1953
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:01,658
but I think it's best

1954
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:01,658
if I pick my own dates.

1955
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,866
Dad, she's perfect.

1956
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,866
She likes music,

1957
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,866
she's smart,

1958
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,866
she's beautiful.

1959
00:58:05,908 --> 00:58:08,118
She's 15 years

1960
00:58:05,908 --> 00:58:08,118
younger than me.

1961
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,909
Age is just a state

1962
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,909
of mind, Dad.

1963
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:13,784
You're young at heart,

1964
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:13,784
right? Can you please

1965
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:13,784
just talk to her?

1966
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:16,659
I'm sure you'd like her

1967
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:16,659
a lot more than Kelly.

1968
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,325
She's hot.

1969
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:21,118
Al, I am not going out

1970
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:21,118
with Miss Cole.

1971
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,118
[knock at door]

1972
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,118
[Kelly]

1973
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,118
Ben?

1974
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:25,701
Hi.

1975
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:25,701
Hi.

1976
00:58:27,368 --> 00:58:29,451
Am I interrupting?

1977
00:58:27,368 --> 00:58:29,451
Uh, no.

1978
00:58:29,493 --> 00:58:31,701
No, I think, um,

1979
00:58:31,743 --> 00:58:33,618
we're good here.

1980
00:58:40,243 --> 00:58:43,536
If he thinks I'm just

1981
00:58:40,243 --> 00:58:43,536
giving up like that,

1982
00:58:40,243 --> 00:58:43,536
he's crazy.

1983
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:47,078
Thanks for the ride.

1984
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,161
The mechanic said

1985
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,161
my car would be

1986
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,161
fixed yesterday,

1987
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:51,161
so it'll probably be

1988
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:51,161
sometime next week.

1989
00:58:51,202 --> 00:58:52,869
[chuckles]

1990
00:58:51,202 --> 00:58:52,869
My pleasure.

1991
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:57,869
Besides, I had to

1992
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:57,869
find some way

1993
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,994
to thank you for

1994
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,994
that great dinner.

1995
00:59:12,245 --> 00:59:15,245
That feels...very good.

1996
00:59:16,328 --> 00:59:18,454
I can't.

1997
00:59:18,496 --> 00:59:20,454
What's wrong?

1998
00:59:20,496 --> 00:59:22,538
[Ben]

1999
00:59:20,496 --> 00:59:22,538
I...I like you.

2000
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:26,038
I mean, I really do.

2001
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:26,038
It's just, um...

2002
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,038
my life's kind of

2003
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,038
complicated right now.

2004
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,287
Ben, Marie has been

2005
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,287
gone for 6 years.

2006
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:36,705
I know.

2007
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:39,664
It's time to move on.

2008
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:39,664
It's just, uh,

2009
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:42,039
I just moved here

2010
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:44,414
and I bought

2011
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:44,414
this store,

2012
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,831
and my kids,

2013
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,831
especially Alice,

2014
00:59:47,872 --> 00:59:49,997
she has a lot

2015
00:59:47,872 --> 00:59:49,997
going on right now.

2016
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,915
What about yourself?

2017
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,915
I'm not sure.

2018
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:56,998
I'm not trying to rush

2019
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:56,998
you into anything.

2020
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,165
No, you're great.

2021
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,165
It's just, um,

2022
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,748
like I said,

2023
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,748
it's complicated.

2024
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,498
I'm not giving up on you.

2025
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,540
Just know that.

2026
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,667
Dad, what's with

2027
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,667
the dead bird?

2028
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,792
It's Thanksgiving.

2029
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,959
Again I ask, what's

2030
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,959
with the dead bird?

2031
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,959
We always go out.

2032
01:00:35,1000 --> 01:00:38,208
Oh, no. Not this year.

2033
01:00:35,1000 --> 01:00:38,208
Not with Sally

2034
01:00:35,1000 --> 01:00:38,208
and Milt coming.

2035
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,126
No, we're gonna

2036
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,126
have a traditional

2037
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,126
Thanksgiving dinner

2038
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,417
with a traditional

2039
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,417
Thanksgiving turkey.

2040
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,291
And traditional

2041
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,291
food poisoning?

2042
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,168
Elizabeth told me

2043
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,960
if the turkey's

2044
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,960
not properly cooked,

2045
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,960
the bacteria could kill us.

2046
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:52,292
Hear that, Dad?

2047
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:52,292
I'm too young to die.

2048
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:52,292
Me too.

2049
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,292
Okay, if you're not gonna

2050
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,292
help me cook,

2051
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:56,085
then you go upstairs

2052
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:56,085
and clean it up.

2053
01:00:56,127 --> 01:00:58,376
I need it in decent shape

2054
01:00:56,127 --> 01:00:58,376
by the time they get here.

2055
01:00:58,418 --> 01:01:01,001
Smiley girl, you go

2056
01:00:58,418 --> 01:01:01,001
do the laundry.

2057
01:01:01,043 --> 01:01:02,836
Yes, you.

2058
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:12,669
Okay, it's just

2059
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:12,669
me and you now.

2060
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:20,003
[groans]

2061
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:27,045
[groans]

2062
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:38,046
Hello. Ooh!

2063
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:44,130
[disposal whirrs]

2064
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:46,004
Ugh!

2065
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:53,963
[retches]

2066
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,964
[grunting]

2067
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,090
Ow!

2068
01:02:25,048 --> 01:02:25,965
Ah! Hot!

2069
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:34,049
[clattering]

2070
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:34,049
No. No, no.

2071
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:58,842
[footsteps approaching]

2072
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:01,550
Laundry's done.

2073
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:02,883
Need anything else?

2074
01:03:02,925 --> 01:03:05,217
Uh, yeah.

2075
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,509
You know that big

2076
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,509
serving platter

2077
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,509
that we have?

2078
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,135
I think it's probably

2079
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,135
in one of those boxes

2080
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:10,384
we haven't unpacked

2081
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:10,384
downstairs.

2082
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:15,968
You've got to be

2083
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:15,968
kidding me.

2084
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:23,593
Ah, there you are.

2085
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:43,761
[Ben]

2086
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:43,761
Alice! Did you

2087
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:43,761
find the platter?

2088
01:03:43,803 --> 01:03:45,219
Uh, I got it!

2089
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:50,386
My teacher just

2090
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:50,386
gave me an "A"

2091
01:03:50,428 --> 01:03:52,428
for the last English

2092
01:03:50,428 --> 01:03:52,428
report I did.

2093
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:55,178
She said I had

2094
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:55,178
a talent for writing.

2095
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:56,428
I'm also in

2096
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:56,428
the school musical.

2097
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:57,429
It's a small part,

2098
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,804
but I have

2099
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,804
my own dance number,

2100
01:03:58,846 --> 01:04:00,262
so it's really important

2101
01:03:58,846 --> 01:04:00,262
to the story.

2102
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,804
Oh, honey,

2103
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,804
that is very good!

2104
01:04:02,846 --> 01:04:05,595
Alice, put your napkin

2105
01:04:02,846 --> 01:04:05,595
on your lap, hon.

2106
01:04:07,345 --> 01:04:09,262
Ben, put your napkin

2107
01:04:07,345 --> 01:04:09,262
on your lap.

2108
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,971
Lester,

2109
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,971
you too, hon.

2110
01:04:12,012 --> 01:04:14,721
And what about you, honey?

2111
01:04:12,012 --> 01:04:14,721
How are your grades?

2112
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:17,471
Pretty good.

2113
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:17,471
I'm only failing

2114
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:17,471
3 of my classes.

2115
01:04:17,513 --> 01:04:21,471
Lester, stop it.

2116
01:04:17,513 --> 01:04:21,471
He's doing fine, Sally.

2117
01:04:21,513 --> 01:04:23,263
Well, I hope so.

2118
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:26,555
Junior year is

2119
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:26,555
the most important

2120
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:26,555
one for colleges.

2121
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,013
I'm not going to college.

2122
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:30,055
I'm going on tour

2123
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:30,055
with my band.

2124
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:32,639
Or joining

2125
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:32,639
the Merchant Marines.

2126
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:34,014
What did I say?

2127
01:04:34,056 --> 01:04:35,597
She knows I'm kidding.

2128
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,931
Don't you,

2129
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,931
Aunt Sally?

2130
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:40,681
Well, of course I do.

2131
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:43,889
But you are going

2132
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:43,889
to college, aren't you?

2133
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:45,181
It's his decision,

2134
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:45,181
not ours.

2135
01:04:45,222 --> 01:04:48,140
But do you think

2136
01:04:45,222 --> 01:04:48,140
that's wise?

2137
01:04:48,181 --> 01:04:51,473
I think that, uh,

2138
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:54,099
everyone should get

2139
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:54,099

2140
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,849
or herself what

2141
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,849
their future should be.

2142
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,099
But he hasn't even

2143
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,099

2144
01:04:59,974 --> 01:05:02,807
I don't think

2145
01:04:59,974 --> 01:05:02,807

2146
01:04:59,974 --> 01:05:02,807
I think I know

2147
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:05,807
better than you

2148
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:05,807

2149

2157

2158
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:28,308

2159
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:28,308
I love them so much.

2160
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:37,809

Um, I'm sorry

2162
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,725

how much you love them,

2168
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:48,810
and I can use all

2169

01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:40,555
in front of

2499
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:40,555
all those people?

2500
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,222
Thanks.

2501
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:44,472
I think.

2502
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,182
Alice,

2503
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:50,598
I owe you an apology.

2504
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,473
I overreacted last night

2505
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,473
and jumped to conclusions.

2506
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:55,514
I'm sorry.

2507
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:58,098
I hope you'll stay

2508
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:58,098
for the party.

2509
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,764
And then afterwards

2510
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,764
maybe you can help me

2511
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,764
clean up a bit?

2512
01:17:00,806 --> 01:17:02,682
I'll give you a ride home

2513
01:17:00,806 --> 01:17:02,682
if it's too late to walk.

2514
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,057
I'd love to stay

2515
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,057
and help,

2516
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:07,932
but I actually have

2517
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:07,932
to go meet someone.

2518
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,766
Isn't it funny how

2519
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,766
I've been trying to be

2520
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,766
friends with Miss Cole

2521
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,808
just so she could

2522
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,808
be my role model

2523
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:26,641
when my real role model was

2524
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:26,641
standing right before me?

2525
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:34,017
Hi, Mrs. Plotkin.

2526
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:34,017
Oh, hi, Alice.

2527
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:37,267
Theatre club was having

2528
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:37,267
a party, so I thought

2529
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:37,267
I'd bring you some cake.

2530
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:39,476
That is so sweet

2531
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:39,476
of you.

2532
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:41,684
You know,

2533
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:44,893
I was just thinking about

2534
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:44,893
taking a little break myself.

2535
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:48,517
Have a seat.

2536
01:17:50,059 --> 01:17:51,143
I just want to thank you

2537
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:52,350
for helping me

2538
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:52,350
the other night.

2539
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:53,767
It really made me

2540
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:53,767
feel better.

2541
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:55,768
Oh, it's my pleasure.

2542
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,768
I was wondering if

2543
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,768
I could come back

2544
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,894
and help you

2545
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,894
clean the room

2546
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,894
in the afternoons.

2547
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,768
Oh, that isn't

2548
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,768
necessary, hon.

2549
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,602
No, I'd like to, really.

2550
01:18:05,393 --> 01:18:07,602
I'm trying to say

2551
01:18:05,393 --> 01:18:07,602
it won't be necessary

2552
01:18:07,643 --> 01:18:09,477
because...

2553
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,061
I'm not returning to school

2554
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,061
after winter break.

2555
01:18:13,811 --> 01:18:15,187
Well, when are

2556
01:18:13,811 --> 01:18:15,187
you coming back?

2557
01:18:16,853 --> 01:18:19,187
September,

2558
01:18:16,853 --> 01:18:19,187
at the earliest.

2559
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:22,811
I've decided to take

2560
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:22,811
a sabbatical.

2561
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:24,728
You know I've

2562
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:24,728
been working here

2563
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:24,728
over 25 years?

2564
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:30,021
I decided I'd like to spend

2565
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:30,021
a little more time at home.

2566
01:18:30,062 --> 01:18:32,104
You can't just leave

2567
01:18:30,062 --> 01:18:32,104
in the middle of the year.

2568
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:35,104
Well, I know it's not

2569
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:35,104
great timing, Alice,

2570
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:37,104
but that's the way things

2571
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:37,104
work out sometimes.

2572
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,437
But I have been

2573
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,437
thinking that

2574
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:42,812
if you would still like

2575
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:42,812
to be in Miss Cole's class,

2576
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:46,188
that I could maybe

2577
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:46,188
get Mr. Edgecombe

2578
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:49,230
to agree to transfer

2579
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:49,230
you there.

2580
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:52,147
Due to the circumstances

2581
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:52,147
and all.

2582
01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:54,354
I don't want

2583
01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:54,354
to be transferred,

2584
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,189
and I think what

2585
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,189
you're doing is awful!

2586
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:59,313
Alice...

2587
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:59,313
Alice, come back!

2588
01:19:01,688 --> 01:19:04,606
Alice, stop.

2589
01:19:01,688 --> 01:19:04,606
Please?

2590
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:07,606
I know you're upset,

2591
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:07,606
and I understand that.

2592
01:19:07,647 --> 01:19:09,064
But please let me explain

2593
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:11,439
the real reason why

2594
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:11,439
I'm leaving, okay?

2595
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:13,564
You're not going

2596
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:13,564
on sabbatical?

2597
01:19:13,606 --> 01:19:15,814
Well, yes, I am,

2598
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:18,689
but not because

2599
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:18,689
I want to.

2600
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:21,272
My doctor

2601
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:21,272
has recommended it.

2602
01:19:21,314 --> 01:19:23,565
Your doctor?

2603
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:25,732
You see, Alice,

2604
01:19:25,773 --> 01:19:28,065
I have a problem

2605
01:19:25,773 --> 01:19:28,065
with my heart.

2606
01:19:28,107 --> 01:19:31,191
One of my valves

2607
01:19:28,107 --> 01:19:31,191
isn't right.

2608
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:34,398
So they have to do

2609
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:34,398
an operation to fix it.

2610
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,065
Are you gonna be

2611
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,065
all right?

2612
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:40,399
Well, I certainly

2613
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:40,399
hope so.

2614
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,774
I mean, they'll do

2615
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,774
the surgery and treatment

2616
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:44,983
and all sorts of therapy

2617
01:19:45,025 --> 01:19:46,816
that'll make me

2618
01:19:45,025 --> 01:19:46,816
weak and tired,

2619
01:19:46,858 --> 01:19:48,066
but in a few months,

2620
01:19:48,108 --> 01:19:50,733
the doctor says

2621
01:19:48,108 --> 01:19:50,733
I should be fine.

2622
01:19:50,774 --> 01:19:52,274
I'm really sorry.

2623
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:53,691
Me too.

2624
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:56,942
But thank you.

2625
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:09,692
[knocking]

2626
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:09,692
Al?

2627
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:13,151
Go away.

2628
01:20:15,735 --> 01:20:17,651
Mrs. Plotkin called.

2629
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:20,776
She's worried

2630
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:20,776
about you.

2631
01:20:20,818 --> 01:20:24,110
She told me

2632
01:20:20,818 --> 01:20:24,110
what happened.

2633
01:20:20,818 --> 01:20:24,110
I'm sorry.

2634
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,276
Well, I'm not.

2635
01:20:26,318 --> 01:20:28,318
Not anymore.

2636
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:29,693
Don't say that.

2637
01:20:29,735 --> 01:20:32,444
Why not?

2638
01:20:32,486 --> 01:20:35,694
I may not see her again.

2639
01:20:32,486 --> 01:20:35,694
Why should I care?

2640
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:37,861
You don't mean that.

2641
01:20:37,903 --> 01:20:40,569
Once someone's gone,

2642
01:20:37,903 --> 01:20:40,569
they're gone.

2643
01:20:40,611 --> 01:20:42,944
What good does it do

2644
01:20:40,611 --> 01:20:42,944
to think about them?

2645
01:20:42,986 --> 01:20:45,611
It doesn't make them any better.

2646
01:20:42,986 --> 01:20:45,611
It only makes you feel sad.

2647
01:20:45,652 --> 01:20:47,819
Alice, stop.

2648
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:50,528
Isn't that why

2649
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:50,528
you never want to watch

2650
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:50,528
the videotapes of Mom?

2651
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,653
Isn't that why you want

2652
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,653
to date Kelly?

2653
01:20:52,695 --> 01:20:54,945
'Cause you never want

2654
01:20:52,695 --> 01:20:54,945
to think about Mom!

2655
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:58,653
I think about your mother

2656
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:58,653
every moment of my life.

2657
01:20:58,695 --> 01:21:00,361
Alice...

2658
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,487
there isn't an hour

2659
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,487
that goes by

2660
01:21:04,528 --> 01:21:05,945
that I don't wonder,

2661
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:08,279
"What would she do?

2662
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:08,279
What would she think?"

2663
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:14,155
I love her more than

2664
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:14,155
anything in the world,

2665
01:21:14,197 --> 01:21:17,197
except maybe

2666
01:21:14,197 --> 01:21:17,197
you and Lester.

2667
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:19,654
How come we never

2668
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:19,654
talk about her?

2669
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:21,488
How come I haven't

2670
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:21,488
seen the tapes?

2671
01:21:23,404 --> 01:21:26,198
It was wrong of me to keep

2672
01:21:23,404 --> 01:21:26,198
that stuff from you guys.

2673
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:29,405
I just...

2674
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:29,405
I wanted us

2675
01:21:29,447 --> 01:21:33,447
to grow as a family,

2676
01:21:29,447 --> 01:21:33,447
not be stuck in the past.

2677
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,447
I think about her

2678
01:21:35,489 --> 01:21:37,864
all the time,

2679
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:40,614
even though I can't

2680
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:40,614
remember her.

2681
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:44,573
I know you do.

2682
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:44,573
You probably will

2683
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:44,573
your whole life.

2684
01:21:44,615 --> 01:21:46,323
I know I will.

2685
01:21:48,157 --> 01:21:51,615
Just because

2686
01:21:48,157 --> 01:21:51,615
she isn't here,

2687
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,199
it doesn't mean that

2688
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,199
